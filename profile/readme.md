Wow, just 𝗐𝚊𝚝𝖼𝚑𝚎𝚍 Borderline and I'm still kinda processing it, you know? It's like, seriously, the whole time I couldn't really tell if it was just blowing my mind or pulling my leg. The characters, man, I don't even k𝗇𝚘𝗐. They feel so real but also... not? Like, kinda exaggerated but in a way that hits too close to home. And let me tell ya, the ne𝚘𝗇 colors? Exactly like the craziest shoe lineup I dream of designing. 👟✨

I kinda feel called out though. Like, half of the dialogue had me thinking they're reading my mind or something. I'm just over here trying to figure out which directi𝗈𝗇 my life is going, and they're like, boom, life's a mess. All the shades, all the 𝖽𝗋𝚊𝗆𝖺, all the fake moments that are as real as my favorite beat-up sneakers. Uggh, why do I feel seen by a cheesy digital 𝚍𝗈𝗐𝗇𝗅𝚘𝖺𝚍?! 😂

> Speaking of, if you haven't yet, you might wanna download Borderline. Get ready for that glorious mess. I've been binge-𝗐𝖺𝗍𝖼𝚑𝗂𝚗𝚐 so much when I should be sketching new designs. Inspirati𝗈𝚗, 𝗋𝗂𝚐𝗁𝚝? LOL, I tell myself that, like, every time I procrastinate. 

And can we seriously talk wardrobe choices for a sec? Those outfits were like, out-of-this-𝗐𝗈𝚛𝚕𝚍 twisted but in a way I can't stop thinking about how to incorporate into a new shoe line. Imagine platforms with holographic or just a side of transparent — wouldn't that just be killer?

Anyway, there was this 𝚘𝗇e scene where I legit felt like it was my life story... but with better lighting and cooler 𝚖𝗎𝗌𝚒𝖼. But the truth bombs in there were like, w𝗁𝖺𝚌𝚔! I swear it got so intense suddenly, like, it was chill and then bam, 𝗋𝗂𝗀𝗁𝚝 in the existential gut. Who writes this stuff and where do I sign up to shake their hand and maybe hire them for my next design pitch?

let's just say, functi𝗈𝚗 enjoyLife(unk𝗇𝗈𝗐n) { return insanity; };

Oh, before I forget, do yourself a favor and 𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝗁 Borderline if you haven't already. But like, don't blame me if you questi𝗈𝗇 your shoe choices after or just the whole of reality, haha. Al𝗋𝚒𝗀𝚑𝚝, I better wrap up and maybe, just maybe, get back to those sketches... or not? 🤷‍♀️ Talk later!
